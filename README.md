# Bigger Breakout Box

Don't you hate how difficult it is to sort the breakout rooms in Google Meet? Me too.

## What is this?

It's an extension that adds a button with a single function. Change the size of the breakout room controls from tiny to 100% screen width (and back again).

## Why is this?

Because the current breaout controls suck.

## How is this?

I am cheap and lazy so I don't want to pay the fee to get this on the Chrome Store. To get this working:

- Download the files and unzip them somewhere on your computer.
- Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
- Check the "Developer Mode" in the top right
- Click "Load Unpacked" and find the folder you just downloaded
- Profit?

## When is this?

I'll probably add it to the chrome store soon, but effort, you know?
